The `collector` tool attempts to automate the process of splitting the `Illuminate\Support\Collection` component from the Laravel code-base. It strives to solve this issue: https://github.com/tightenco/collect/issues/2. The output of this utility can be viewed at https://github.com/JohnathonKoster/collector-output-test (it is not recommended to use the releases within the `collector-output-test` repository directly; instead, use Tighten Co's repository).
